The big national trends—the aging of the population, the increasing diversity, the growth in the South, and the decline in the Rust Belt—are already in evidence and will likely continue. But at the local level, the stories are more complex and varied, and still subject to change.</h4><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div><p>These demographic shifts matter a great deal to state and local governments. New York City is struggling to provide enough housing for an expected population boom by 2040, while Detroit is figuring out how to downsize wisely to match a shrinking population that may shrink even more.</p><p>To help visualize the future, the Urban Institute developed Mapping America’s Futures: a tool that projects population trends out to 2030 (the tab on the right will take you there). Pick low, average, or high rates for birth, death, and migration—the three drivers of population change—and the map changes in response.</p><p>The rates are all reasonable assumptions, based on historical trends that may be somewhat lower or higher by 2030. In other words, it won’t show a future where no children are born and no one dies, but we could imagine a future where people moved around more or fertility drops by 20 percent of what it was over the past decade. With the tool, people can explore several possible scenarios—possible futures—and see how they’ll play out in different regions.</p><p>A future with more births and longer lives looks very different from one with fewer births and high mortality. And migration—one of the most difficult forces to predict—can change areas rapidly, not just in sheer numbers, but also in terms of its racial and ethnic makeup, its workers and tax base, its demand for housing and for government services, and, arguably, its character.</p><img data-src="images/yt_ga-sm.jpg" class="feature-image img-responsive img-rounded async"><div class="quote-wrapper"><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div><div class="quote">Planning for growth and decline:<br>the futures of Atlanta and Youngstown</div><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div></div><p>To better understand how population projections can help cities and states plan for change, let’s look at two places on two very different trajectories: Atlanta, Georgia, and Youngstown, Ohio.</p><p>Because city and state boundaries don’t always capture the relationships between places, Mapping America’s Futures is broken down into 740 commuting zones—places connected by local economies, which can cross city and state boundaries, and that include metro and rural areas.</p><p>So what’s the best scenario for a Rust Belt commuting zone like Youngstown, Ohio? The whole country grows when birth rates are high and mortality is low, but a key difference between Youngstown and Atlanta is what happens when you change the migration rate.</p><p>A once-booming steel town, Youngstown has lost half its residents since manufacturing declined in the 1950s. Its neighbors in the Great Lakes region, from Minneapolis to Pittsburgh, grew slowly or lost population over the past decade, following a long-time trend of people migrating from the North to the South.</p><p>In 2010, the Youngstown commuting zone had a population of 762,509, down from X in 2000. Its best hope is a future with less migration—that is, fewer young, working-age people leaving the area. <a class="jump-to-map" data-fertility="avg" data-mortality="avg" data-migration="high" data-boundary="czones" data-czone="0" data-age="all" data-race="all" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="click to view in map">Set the model to high migration (and average birth and death rates)</a> and Youngstown loses 14 percent of its population by 2030; <a class="jump-to-map" data-fertility="avg" data-mortality="avg" data-migration="low" data-boundary="czones" data-czone="0" data-age="all" data-race="all" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="click to view in map">switch it to low</a> and the area’s population only declines by 5 percent.</p><div class="inline-maps"><div class="inline-maps-header"><h1>Youngstown 2030</h1><h2>Average Birth, Average Death</h2></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">High migration</label><div id="youngstown-high"></div></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">Low migration</label><div id="youngstown-low"></div></div><div class="inline-map-legend" id="youngstown"></div></div><p>"Fewer people means less demand for housing, which means lower property tax revenues," said Rolf Pendall, director of Urban’s Metropolitan and Communities Policy Center. "And it will cause a strain on government resources because the out-migration would reduce the labor force," decreasing tax revenue to pay for things like roads, schools, utilities, and public services.</p><p>Youngstown is also projected to have a high and growing share of residents age 65 and up—up 42 percent by 2030 under the average scenario. This is the age range when people typically retire, further lowering labor force participation.</p><p>But Pendall sees the retirement of the baby boomers as an opportunity to open up jobs for younger residents, keeping them from moving away to seek work. The challenge for Youngstown and other Rust Belt cities will be ensuring that younger residents have the education and training needed to fill those jobs and make a successful transition from one generation to the next.</p><p>In Atlanta, the same forces have different effects. The Atlanta commuting zone grew by X people from 2000 to 2010, many drawn by the area’s economic growth, low housing costs, and low taxes. Other areas in the South also grew, like commuting zones in the Piedmont region (which stretches from southern Virginia to Birmingham, Alabama); Houston, Dallas, Austin, and other parts of Texas propelled by high oil and gas prices; and Central Florida, which was buoyed by tourism and real estate construction.</p><p>Unlike in Youngstown, migration favors Atlanta and other fast-growth areas. Less migration means the population grows by 43 percent—not insignificant, but far less than the incredible 72 percent growth Atlanta would see under a future where people move around the country more. The percentages won’t be exact in 2030, but they point to a consistent pattern of growth.</p><div class="inline-maps"><div class="inline-maps-header"><h1>Atlanta 2030</h1><h2>Average Birth, Average Death</h2></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">High migration</label><div id="atlanta-high"></div></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">Low migration</label><div id="atlanta-low"></div></div><div class="inline-map-legend" id="atlanta"></div></div><p>But can Atlanta handle that kind of population boom? Can Texas or other fast-growth areas?</p><p>"Water scarcity is an increasing issue in Georgia for urban users, as is groundwater depletion in Texas," Pendall said. "And the southeast Atlantic Coast and Florida have the greatest hazards of hurricanes, coastal flooding, and the potential impact of climate change on severe weather. There are a lot of people moving to areas where they will be exposed to those kinds of risks."</p><p>Also, like Youngstown, Atlanta’s future will see more people who are not in the labor force—not because working-age people are leaving, but just as a natural consequence of a growing population.</p><p>"With Atlanta, you might think, great, the economy and the population are booming, but that doesn’t protect it from having to think carefully about its changing labor force," said Steven Martin, senior research associate at the Urban Institute. "Atlanta will also have a proportionate large growth in needs and they don’t have the infrastructure in place yet to deal with it."</p><img data-src="images/shutterstock_217103686-sm.jpg" class="feature-image img-responsive img-rounded async"><div class="quote-wrapper"><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div><div class="quote">Don’t forget about Generation Z</div><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div></div><p>Mapping America’s Future also allows users to see how specific age and race groups may change in the future.</p><p>By 2030, the population of the United States age 65 and over will increase dramatically, putting pressure on health and long-term care services and government programs funded by a smaller base of taxpayers. Pick the average birth, death, and migration rates and Boise’s 65-and-over population goes up by 140 percent. Raleigh’s grows by 151 percent and Albuquerque’s by 111 percent.</p><p>This isn’t new news. But the aging of America hides another equally important story: the substantial number of young people in every city and state who also rely on taxpayer investments. They’re the children of the Millennials, many of whom haven’t been born yet. And states and localities will still need to invest in their education, health care, and other needs, even in the face of higher demand for services for the elderly.</p><p>"We have a lot of children to take care of and nobody’s talking about that," said Nan Astone, Urban Institute senior fellow. "Because the national debate about aging dominates the conversation, you’d think that the younger population was decreasing, but it’s not… and states will be increasingly strapped."</p><p>The state and local picture is particularly important for the young population, Astone said, because states spend more on children and youth than the federal government does. But states also pay for programs and services for the elderly. In many commuting zones, the taxes necessary to invest in both of these populations will be paid for by a slow-growing or declining working-age population, putting extreme pressure on government budgets.</p><p>In some fast-growth areas like Atlanta, the working-age population is projected to grow, but so will the number of young people, creating new demands for resources and infrastructure, like more teachers and classrooms.</p><img data-src="images/shutterstock_119607373-sm.jpg" class="feature-image img-responsive img-rounded async"><div class="quote-wrapper"><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div><div class="quote">Greater diversity in nearly every city and state</div><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div></div><p>The population nationwide is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse—and that’s true in nearly every commuting zone. But how and why the racial make-up of local populations is changing varies.</p><p>"Pretty much the entire United States is becoming less white. Not only are white shares decreasing nationwide, but they are decreasing everywhere—in the Midwest and the Southeast, in big cities and in rural areas, in places where whites are leaving and in places where whites are moving to," Martin said. "I think that’s going to more rapidly change our perceptions of what America is: that it’s a place that is diverse."</p><p>The future racial and ethnic make-up of a commuting zone is useful information for nonprofits, schools, and city planners, said William Fulton, San Diego’s former planning director.</p><p>"Generally speaking, we see that different populations live together in different household sizes and often have different levels of educational attainment. And, partly as a result of those things, they have different commuting patterns," said Fulton, who also served as mayor of Ventura, California. "So, knowing the components of the population…is very valuable" for state and local governments.</p><div class="inline-maps"><div class="inline-maps-header"><h1>Race Change in 2030</h1><h2>Average Birth, Average Death, Average Migration</h2></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">All Races</label><div id="races-inline-all"></div></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">White</label><div id="races-inline-white"></div></div><div class="inline-map-legend-container"><div class="inline-map-legend" id="races-inline"></div></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">Black</label><div id="races-inline-black"></div></div><div class="map-box"><label class="centered">Hispanic</label><div id="races-inline-hispanic"></div></div></div><p>The Hispanic share of the population is expected to increase almost everywhere, especially in the South, by 2030. Hispanic women have had the highest fertility rates in the country, but...</p><p>What’s happening among the black population is more complex, Martin said. Blacks began leaving the South in the 1930s for urban centers in the North that offered greater economic opportunities, like auto industry jobs in Detroit and Chicago. But as those industries declined, blacks began returning to the South—partly for jobs, but also to reconnect with family and cultural ties.</p><p>What’s more, in the South, blacks are projected to move out of rural areas and into central cities. In the North, the reverse is happening, with blacks moving out of cities. While the black population is still projected to grow overall in the North, the black share of the population is expected to shrink in large cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.</p><p>"For blacks, this level of migration is relatively recent," Martin said. "It used to be that blacks moved around at lower rates than whites because there was a lot of race-related constraints on movement, and some of those constraints are lifting."</p><p>In other commuting zones, diversity is a consequence of who’s moving out. The large number of people projected to leave Youngstown by 2030 not only affects the area’s labor force, it also changes the racial mix. Blacks are moving out, but whites are moving out faster.</p><p>"This will be the first time a lot of areas in the North having a growing black share of the population," Martin said. "But when an area is becoming more diverse because lots of whites are moving out, that’s usually because the economy is struggling." The challenge for local governments in places like Youngstown is realizing and sustaining the benefits of greater diversity in the face of economic struggles and shrinking resources.</p><img data-src="images/AP448161014046-sm.jpg" class="feature-image img-responsive img-rounded async"><div class="quote-wrapper"><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div><div class="quote">Demography is not destiny</div><div class="hr-wrapper"><hr class="orange-hr"></div></div><p>When he was director of San Diego’s planning commission, Fulton used projections like these to guide city planning and combat perceptions about how change was occurring.</p><p>“Sometimes, people’s idea of what their community is like gets fixed at a fairly early age when they buy a house and when they have kids, and it’s hard for them to change that later on,” he said. “If you have statistical information, I think it becomes more possible to have a conversation about how things are changing and what you’re going to do about it.”</p><p>Policies can still change our course. Immigration reform could affect the number of immigrants who come here and where they live, depending on whether reform leads to more work visas or more immigrants coming to reunite with family. Local policies can have an effect too. Inclusionary zoning, for example, which requires that new residential buildings set aside low- and moderate-income units, could make it possible to manage growth in booming areas, while also attracting a greater pool of new residents.</p><p>If the Keystone Pipeline is built, commuting zones along its path may get a population boost, while new environmental regulations could affect the coal industry and populations dependent on it for jobs, Astone said. Climate change and natural disasters could significantly affect where people can or want to live. And rapid population growth can drive up housing prices to the point where growth slows down.</p><p>The model doesn’t account for how likely researchers think these or other events will occur. It isn’t a prediction in that it doesn’t anticipate policy, said Austin Nichols, Urban Institute affiliated scholar, who helped develop the tool. Rather it’s a projection based on historical trends. The goal isn’t to provide an exact, specific forecast, but, instead, to show how patterns emerge as you change a few variables.</p><p>In other words, the future is still open: our actions and our policies can still shape where we’re going.</p><p>“It’s not predicting the future,” Nichols said. “But in a broad sweep, it captures an essential truth about what will happen.”</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="feature-footer"></div></div><div class="item" id="map"><div class="view_button right" id="feature">READ THE<br>ARTICLE</div><div class="fill"><div class="container"><div class="col-md-12 item-container extra-padding" id="map-tool-container"><div class="row" id="top-row"><div class="col-md-12"><div class="col-md-12"><h1>Mapping America's Futures</h1><p class="map-more-text">Test possible scenarios for how the US population might change in 2020 and 2030.
